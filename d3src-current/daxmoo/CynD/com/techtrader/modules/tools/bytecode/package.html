	<p><b>Bytecode Manipuation</b></p>
	<p>
		This package exports facilities for bytecode manipulation.
		In order to perform any advanced manipulation, some understanding of
		the 
		<a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/vmspec/2nd-edition/html/ClassFile.doc.html">
		.class file format</a> and of the 
		<a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/vmspec/2nd-edition/html/Instructions.doc.html">
		jvm instruction set</a> is necessary.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is recommended that new users start with the 
		{@link com.techtrader.modules.tools.bytecode.BCClass} class
		documentation to get a feel for the utilities that this package
		provides. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The {@link com.techtrader.modules.tools.bytecode.Code} class is used 
		to manipulate actual instructions 
		(as opposed
		to larger structures of the class like methods, fields, superclass,
		etc).  It contains methods corresponding the the instruction set
		of the JVM; see its javadoc documentation for details.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Implementation Note</b>: 
		Bytecode files contain a constant pool, which
		contains entries for all the constants, the class, field, and method
		references, etc used in the class.  Often, these constants are 
		pointed to by multiple other constants or instructions in the code, 
		and so changing a constant in one place can affect the behavior of 
		other code, or even render the class invalid.  
		At the same time, adding duplicate constant
		pool entries for repeated constants can lead to
		a much larger .class file than necessary, which drains resources.
		This framework guarantees that no constant will appear more than once
		in the constant pool, but at the same time it tries to minimize the
		chances of a bytecode change having effects beyond its exepected scope.
		In this regard, the framework has the following behavior with respect 
		to the constant pool:<br>
		<ul>
			<li>
			Changing the name of a BCClass changes the constant pool 
			ClassEntry name, so <i>all references to the class in code are
			automatically changed to reference the new name</i>, with the
			following exceptions:<br>
			If the class name is referenced as a String constant in code, 
			this constant will remain unchanged.  Fields contained in the
			class that are of the same type as the class will retain their 
			original type, and methods that return an instance of the class
			or take an instance as an argument will still reference the 
			original type.
			</li>
			<li>
			Changing the name or signature of a BCField or BCMethod does not
			affect the constant pool UTF8Entry that held the original value
			of the name or signature.  Instead, a new UTF8Entry is added.  This
			is done so that constants referenced at other points in the code
			that happen to have the same name and/or signatures as the
			changed entity are not affected.  However, the 
			Field/MethodEntry representing the changed entity is searched for
			and updated to point to the new UTF8Entry, so that <i>all code
			that references the field/method that was changed will automatically
			be updated to reference the new values</i>. 
			</li>
			<li>
			Changing the methods, fields, or constants referenced by one
			code block Instructions will never affect any other Instruction,
			or the class structure itself.
			</li>
			<li>
			Constant pool entries are never deleted.  This can lead to 
			class bloat if many modifications are made to an existing class;
			given the uniqueness guarantee for constant pool entries, however,
			the excess is usually very minor.  Additionally, this guarantees
			that shared constants aren't deleted accidentally.
			</li>
		</ul>

	<p><b>Notable Classes</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>Class {@link com.techtrader.modules.tools.bytecode.BCClass}</b>
			<p>
				Represents a Class at the bytecode level.  A BCClass can be
				created from scratch or from an existing class, file, or 
				stream, and it can then be written to a .class file, a stream, 
				or loaded into a class loader via its getBytes() method.  
				The BCClass acts as
				a factory and manager of its fields and methods, represented
				by {@link com.techtrader.modules.tools.bytecode.BCField} and 
				{@link com.techtrader.modules.tools.bytecode.BCMethod} objects, 
				respectively.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Class {@link com.techtrader.modules.tools.bytecode.Code}</b>
			<p>
				A Code object can be obtained from a 
				{@link com.techtrader.modules.tools.bytecode.BCMethod}, 
				and allows for
				the manipulation of bytecode instructions.  The Code instance
				acts like a {@link java.util.ListIterator} over the instructions
				contained in the method it was obtained from.  Instead of an
				add() method, however, it contains methods representing the
				instruction set of the JVM, where each method adds its
				respective byte representation at the iterator's current 
				position.   Additionally, there are convenience methods
				provided that do not map exactly to any JVM opcode.
